# Discord Form

A tiny package written to serve as a replacement for sending contact forms via mail and rather sends them to your Discord DMs.

### Requirements:
```
- Discord.JS
- Express
```

### Setup:
1. Create a discord bot.
2. Add the bot to a server you are in. (Required for DM permission).
3. Generate a bot token and copy it and place it in config.
4. Enable discord developer mode and copy your USERID (number not tag) and place it in config too.
5. Deploy to Heroku. And link that to your Message Form.
